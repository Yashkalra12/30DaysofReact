## 30 Days of React

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Yash Kalra, a Full Stack Developer passionate about web development. Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™m embarking on a 30-day journey to deepen my knowledge of React and enhance my web development skills.

### What is 30 Days of React?

Over the next 30 days, Iâ€™ll be focusing on mastering React concepts by:
- **Exploring documentation**: Diving into official React resources to understand core features and best practices.
- **Building projects**: Developing small applications and components to apply what I learn.
- **Committing daily**: Documenting my progress, sharing my work, and showcasing my commitment to consistent learning.

This challenge is designed to help me revisit React fundamentals, build discipline, and demonstrate my dedication to growth in web development. I hope my journey can inspire others to take on their own learning challenges!

### What to Expect

- **Daily updates**: Regular commits with explanations of what Iâ€™ve learned or built each day.
- **Projects and components**: Code and examples of various React applications and features.
- **Learning resources**: Links to documentation, tutorials, and articles Iâ€™m using.

Join me on this coding adventure as I dive into React and work towards becoming a better developer! ðŸš€
